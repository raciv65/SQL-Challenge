# SQL-Challenge

In this exercise, the database of employees from 1980 to 1990 is worked.

A database was designed and elaborated on SQL.

Subsequently, the requested analysis was carried out on the same basis; in particular, the following questions:
<ol>
<li>List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.</li>
<li>List employees who were hired in 1986.</li>
<li>List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.</li>
<li>List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.</li>
<li>List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
<li>List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.</li>
<li>List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.</li>
